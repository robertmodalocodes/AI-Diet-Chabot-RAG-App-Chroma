People are often discharged from hospitals with medication but little to no guidance on how diet and lifestyle can support recovery. There is a lack of accessible tools that guide people in using food as a complementary therapy. This gap inspired this project which is to develop an AI chatbot that recommends personalized dietary strategies based on current health conditions. Acting like a friendly personal diet planner, the chatbot retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and generates responses using the Gemini model, ensuring that the recommendations are tailored to the user's needs. \n\nThe chatbot utilizes Google's Gemini model for conversational AI and response generation, combined with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. A basic knowledge base of dietary information is embedded and stored in a ChromaDB vector database for efficient retrieval.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This tool provides general information based on its knowledge base and AI generation. **It is NOT a substitute for professional medical or dietary advice.** Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider or registered dietitian for personalized recommendations specific to your health situation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How it Works\n\n1. **Knowledge Base:** Sample dietary information for different conditions is defined directly within this notebook\n2. **Embedding:** This knowledge base is processed, and each document is converted into a numerical vector using Google's `text-embedding-004` model.\n3. **Vector Store:** These embeddings and the corresponding text documents are stored in a ChromaDB collection (in-memory for simplicity).\n4. **User Query:** When the user provides their health condition, their query is also embedded.\n5. **Retrieval:** ChromaDB is queried to find the documents in the knowledge base whose embeddings are most similar (semantically) to the user's query embedding.\n6. **Generation:** The user's query and the retrieved documents (context) are fed into the Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`) model with a specific prompt instructing it to act as a meal planner and generate recommendations based _only_ on the provided context.\n7. **Interaction:** The user will go through the chat interface, state (like whether a recommendation has been given), and the follow-up conversation loop.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Note that you can't \"Run All\" this notebook as it requires inputs for the tasks.

Let's see what we can do with your diet to help bring that down. Based on what I've got here, we want to focus on the DASH diet principles and keep that sodium way down. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Fruits:** Load up on bananas (for potassium!), berries, apples, oranges, peaches, and melons. Aim for 4-5 servings each day.\n*   **Vegetables:** Leafy greens, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes (sweet potatoes are awesome!) should be your go-to. Aim for 4-5 servings each day.\n*   **Meats/Proteins:** Stick to lean meats like skinless poultry and fish. Beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds are also great. Limit red meat and aim for 6 or fewer ounces of protein per day.\n*   **Grains:** Whole grains are your friend! Oatmeal, brown rice, and whole wheat bread/pasta are great choices. Aim for 6-8 servings daily.\n*   **Dairy:** Go for low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt, and cheese. Aim for 2-3 servings each day.\n*   **Other:** This is super important – limit sodium like crazy! Aim for under 1500mg/day if you can, but definitely under 2300mg. Cut back on added sugars, saturated fats, and trans fats. Use herbs and spices to flavor your food instead of salt, and stay hydrated.\n\nHere's a simple recipe idea to get you started:\n\n**Chicken and Veggie Stir-fry with Brown Rice**\n\n*   Cook brown rice according to package directions.\n*   Stir-fry sliced chicken breast in a little sesame or olive oil until cooked. Remove from wok/pan.\n*   Add chopped vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers, carrots, snow peas) and stir-fry until tender-crisp.\n*   Add chicken back to the pan. Toss with a low-sodium soy sauce (or coconut aminos), ginger, and garlic.\n*   Serve over brown rice.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point.

High blood pressure *and* wanting to build muscle. That's a common goal, and definitely achievable, but we need to balance things carefully. Building muscle often involves dietary changes that could potentially impact blood pressure if not managed correctly.\n\nSince high blood pressure is the primary concern, we need to make sure any muscle-building strategy complements a heart-healthy approach. You can't just slam down protein shakes and expect everything to be fine.\n\nHere's what we need to consider integrating:\n\n*   **Protein Sources:** Prioritize lean protein sources. Think fish (especially fatty fish like salmon, rich in Omega-3s which can help lower blood pressure), chicken breast (skinless), turkey breast, lean beef (in moderation), beans, lentils, tofu, and low-fat dairy (if tolerated and doesn't negatively impact blood pressure). These provide the building blocks for muscle repair and growth *without* the extra saturated fat and sodium that can elevate blood pressure.\n*   **Sodium Intake:** Muscle building often involves more food overall. So, be *extra* vigilant about sodium. Read labels carefully and avoid processed foods, which are often loaded with salt. Learn to season your food with herbs and spices instead.\n*   **Potassium-Rich Foods:** Potassium helps balance out sodium's effects on blood pressure. Focus on incorporating potassium-rich foods like sweet potatoes, spinach, bananas, avocados (in moderation due to fat content), and white beans.\n*   **Strength Training Wisely:** Strength training *can* temporarily raise blood pressure. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and weight. Make sure you are breathing correctly and not holding your breath during lifts. I recommend consulting a qualified personal trainer who has experience working with individuals with high blood pressure. They can design a safe and effective program for you.\n*   **Cardio:** Don't forget cardiovascular exercise! It's essential for heart health and can help lower blood pressure. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio most days of the week.\n*   **Creatine Supplementation:** This is a very common supplement used to help build muscle mass. It is generally recognized to be safe, but some people experience increased fluid retention, which *could* potentially impact blood pressure. It's also metabolized by the kidneys, so if you have any kidney issues, it's important to discuss this with your doctor.\n\nRemember, it is super important to consult your doctor (or a registered dietitian who specializes in hypertension and sports nutrition) before making any major changes to your diet or exercise routine, *especially* with high blood pressure. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific needs and medical history.\n\nDo you want to continue discussing?

I hear you. \"Eating healthy\" is a fantastic goal, especially when we're keeping an eye on that blood pressure. It's all about making smart choices consistently.\n\nSince you want to eat healthy *generally*, let's talk about some key areas that can benefit overall well-being *and* help manage blood pressure. Think of it as a holistic approach!\n\n*   **Focus on Whole Foods:** This means prioritizing foods that are minimally processed and as close to their natural state as possible. Think fruits, veggies, lean proteins, and whole grains. They are packed with nutrients and generally lower in sodium, unhealthy fats, and added sugars, which can negatively impact blood pressure.\n\n*   **The DASH Diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension):** Since high blood pressure is a concern, you might want to research the DASH diet. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts. It limits red meat, sweets, and sugar-sweetened beverages. There's a ton of info online about it, so it's worth a look.\n\n*   **Portion Control:** Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if you overeat them. Using smaller plates and being mindful of your hunger cues can be super helpful.\n\n*   **Hydration is Key:** Water helps your body function properly and can even help lower blood pressure. Aim for at least 8 glasses a day.\n\n*   **Limit Processed Foods, Sodium, and Saturated/Unsaturated Fats:** These are the usual suspects that can wreak havoc on your health, especially when it comes to blood pressure. Read labels carefully!\n\nRemember, small changes can make a big difference over time. Don't try to overhaul your entire diet overnight. Start with one or two areas and gradually build from there.\n\nDo you want to continue discussing?
