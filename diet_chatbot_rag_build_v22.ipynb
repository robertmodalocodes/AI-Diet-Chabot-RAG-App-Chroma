    "This project is a part of 5-day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a simple AI chatbot designed to provide general dietary recommendations based on user-inputted health conditions or diagnoses, acting like a friendly personal diet planner.\n",
    "\n",
    "It utilizes Google's Gemini model for conversational AI and response generation, combined with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. A basic knowledge base of dietary information is embedded and stored in a ChromaDB vector database for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** This tool provides general information based on its knowledge base and AI generation. **It is NOT a substitute for professional medical or dietary advice.** Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider or registered dietitian for personalized recommendations specific to your health situation."

    "## How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Base:** Sample dietary information for different conditions is defined directly within this notebook\n",
    "2. **Embedding:** This knowledge base is processed, and each document is converted into a numerical vector using Google's `text-embedding-004` model.\n",
    "3. **Vector Store:** These embeddings and the corresponding text documents are stored in a ChromaDB collection (in-memory for simplicity).\n",
    "4. **User Query:** When the user provides their health condition, their query is also embedded.\n",
    "5. **Retrieval:** ChromaDB is queried to find the documents in the knowledge base whose embeddings are most similar (semantically) to the user's query embedding.\n",
    "6. **Generation:** The user's query and the retrieved documents (context) are fed into the Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`) model with a specific prompt instructing it to act as a meal planner and generate recommendations based _only_ on the provided context.\n",
    "7. **Interaction:** The user will go through the chat interface, state (like whether a recommendation has been given), and the follow-up conversation loop."

       "*   **Dairy:** Stick to low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt, and cheese. Try to get 2-3 servings each day.\n",
       "*   **Other:** This is important – limit your sodium intake significantly, aiming for under 1500mg a day if you can, but definitely under 2300mg. Cut back on added sugars, saturated fats, and trans fats. Use herbs and spices to flavor your food instead of salt. And don't forget to stay hydrated!\n",

       "\n",
       "*   **Prioritize Lean Protein Sources:** Think chicken breast, fish (salmon is great!), lean beef, turkey, and plant-based options like beans, lentils, tofu, and edamame. These are lower in saturated fat and can help you hit your protein goals without negatively impacting your blood pressure as much as, say, a super fatty cut of steak.\n",
       "*   **Watch the Sodium:** Pay close attention to sodium content in your protein sources (especially processed meats like deli slices). Season your food with herbs and spices instead of relying heavily on salt.\n",
       "*   **Don't Neglect the Potassium:** Potassium helps counter the effects of sodium. Load up on potassium-rich foods like bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach, and avocados. They're also great sources of energy for your workouts.\n",
       "*   **Hydrate Properly:** Staying well-hydrated is crucial for both blood pressure and muscle growth. Aim for plenty of water throughout the day.\n",
       "*   **Resistance Training is Key (but carefully!)**: Resistance training is fantastic for building muscle. However, remember to breathe properly during your sets. Holding your breath can spike your blood pressure. Work with a reasonable weight and prioritize proper form. It may also be worth discussing resistance training with your doctor to make sure you're cleared to continue/begin safely.\n",
       "*   **Monitor your Blood Pressure:** Keep tabs on your blood pressure to see how your diet and training are affecting it. This will help you make adjustments as needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "We can definitely dive deeper into specific meal plans and workout strategies that consider both your blood pressure and muscle-building goals. We could talk about timing your meals, choosing the right supplements (if any), and finding low-sodium protein powders if you use them.

       "*   **Cook at Home More Often:** This gives you more control over ingredients and portion sizes. Restaurant meals are often higher in sodium, fat, and calories.\n",
       "*   **Hydrate Well:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger.\n",
       "*   **Portion Control:** Be mindful of how much you're eating at each meal. Using smaller plates can help.\n",
       "*   **Limit Processed Foods:** These are often high in sodium, unhealthy fats, and added sugars.\n",

    "- Limited Knowledge Base: The sample data in diet_data.py is very basic. A real application needs a comprehensive, medically validated database.\n",
    "- No Real-time Data: Doesn't access external, up-to-the-minute medical information.\n",
    "- Basic RAG: Retrieval is based on simple similarity. More advanced techniques could improve relevance.\n",
    "- No User Profiles: Doesn't store user history, allergies, or preferences across sessions.\n",
    "- Safety: While basic prompts guide the AI, more robust safety layers and content filtering would be needed for a production app.\n",
    "- Error Handling: Basic error handling is included, but could be more comprehensive."
